## Unhandled Empty Request Body in Express.js POST Route

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: failing to handle empty request bodies in POST requests.  The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code, which can lead to unexpected behavior or application crashes. The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version with robust error handling.

**Problem:** The original code lacks error handling for scenarios where the request body is empty. This can occur due to network issues, client-side errors, or other unforeseen circumstances.  Without proper handling, attempting to access properties of an empty object (`req.body`) will either throw an error or lead to unexpected behavior.

**Solution:** The solution involves adding a check to verify if `req.body` is empty before processing the data.  This ensures that the application handles these situations gracefully, preventing unexpected crashes and providing more informative error responses to the client.
